## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sevgi!

I'm a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in business analysis and a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. After earning my BA in International Relations from METU and completing a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Computer and Information Systems at Douglas College, I transitioned into the world of data analytics and tech-driven decision-making.

💼 I have professional experience in the finance sector, where I worked as a Business Analyst at one of Turkey’s largest banks. My work involved pricing strategy, reporting automation, project coordination, and client-focused data solutions.

🔍 My core skills include:
- **Data Analysis** with Python, SQL, and Excel  
- **Visualization & Reporting** with Power BI and Tableau  
- **Machine Learning** for predictive analytics  
- **Web Scraping & Data Cleaning** using Python libraries  
- **Database querying and design**

I’m currently focused on building a stronger portfolio, contributing to open-source projects, and preparing for my next professional opportunity in Canada.

## 📚 Projects  
🚀 Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my [projects](https://github.com/sevgitc/Portfolio-Guide/main/README.md).

You'll find a mix of academic, professional, and personal work. Each project reflects my journey as a data enthusiast — from raw data to refined insights.
